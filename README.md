# CarWale-Website-Automation-Testing
Automated functional and regression testing of key user workflows on CarWale using Selenium WebDriver, Java, and TestNG, following industry-standard testing practices.




🧪 Project Overview

This project focuses on automating essential flows like “Upcoming Cars” selection and brand filtering using a scalable test automation framework.

🎯 Objectives:

* Validate dropdown interaction and selection behavior
* Automate UI flow for filtering upcoming cars by brand
* Generate clean, detailed test reports with failure screenshots
* Execute tests across browsers using parallel execution

| Tool                       | Purpose                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Java                       | Test logic and framework code     |
| Selenium WebDriver         | Web automation engine             |
| TestNG                     | Test execution & management       |
| Maven                      | Build tool and dependency manager |
| Extent Reports             | Reporting and debugging           |
| Git                        | Version control                   |
| ChromeDriver / GeckoDriver | Browser drivers                   |


✅ Features Automated

* Navigation to “Upcoming Cars” section
* Dynamic dropdown handling for brand selection
* Validation of result titles and filters
* Error handling and edge case verification
* Screenshot on test failure
* Parallel test execution via TestNG



🏗️ Framework Highlights

* Built using **Page Object Model (POM)**
* Modular, reusable functions for maintainability
* Test data can be adapted for Data-Driven Testing
* Tests grouped via TestNG annotations and XML suite
* Integrated **Extent Reports** for better visibility
